# maze-solver

This project is trying to find the shortest path
from the starting point to the destination point.
The result is a string with directions from the starting
point to the end showing which steps are required to do
to get the shortest path possible. It is worth noting
that there are more than one possible way of getting to the
end with the least steps.
